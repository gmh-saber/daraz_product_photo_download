## üìÑ Overview

This page provides two JavaScript snippets designed to be run in your web browser's developer console. Each script is tailored to extract and clean image links from a specific type of webpage, and then copies the resulting links to your clipboard for easy use.

## üß† How It Works

### Script 1: For Product Thumbnails

1. **Finds Images by Class**  
   This script searches for all images on the page that have specific, hard-coded CSS class attributes (e.g., `pdp-mod-common-image`).

2. **Cleans a Specific Substring**  
   It then looks for a fixed part of the image URL, like `_120x120q80.jpg_.webp`, and removes it to give you a link to the main, higher-quality image.

3. **Logs and Copies**  
   All the cleaned links are logged to the console and automatically copied to your clipboard.

### Script 2: For Product Details

1. **Finds Images by Container**  
   This more dynamic script first locates a specific section of the webpage using the CSS ID `#module_product_detail` to focus on the product image gallery.

2. **Uses a Dynamic Regex**  
   It uses a regular expression to intelligently remove the size and quality parameters (e.g., `_2200x2200q80.jpg_.webp`) from the URL. This makes it adaptable to different image sizes and file extensions like `.jpg` or `.png`.

3. **Logs and Copies**  
   All the cleaned links are logged to the console and automatically copied to your clipboard.
